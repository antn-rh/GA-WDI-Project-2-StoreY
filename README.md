# GAproject2-StoreY

### About the project 

The idea for StoreY was inspired by popular web apps such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr with the goal of creating a space for users to store their memories (photos, videos, blog posts, etc.) in a single place where they can be shared with other users. StoreY provides a platform for users to see, like, and comment on what others are/have been up to throughout their week. 

### MVP 

The minimum viable product for this web app will include a homepage, ability to navigate between profiles and stories, and sign up options. Users will be able to create a personal account in which they can create stories composed of pictures, videos, or text or their choosing. They will also be able to view other users' stories and have the option of liking and commenting on stories and/or specific posts.
